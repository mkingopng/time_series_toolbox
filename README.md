# time_series_toolbox
### a comprehensive toolbox of time series methods for all imaginable applications.

The goal of this toolbox is to present many time series scenarios and potential ways to perform analysis and 
inference. 

Docs are great, and we should and do read them, but often I feel that there isn't enough examples, or simulated 
problems, It is left to the user to figure out. This could be used as a quick look-up or cheat sheet for 
time series.
